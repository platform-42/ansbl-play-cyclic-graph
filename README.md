* Find directed cycles that start and end at the same node.
* Add time window filtering - To focus on rapid circular transactions (e.g. within 3 days)
* Detect cyclic regions - To find groups of accounts that can reach each other — strongly connected components
* Frequency-based cycle scoring
Let’s say you want to rank cycles by how frequently they occur
* Find large-value circular flows
If you only care about loops moving a lot of money
